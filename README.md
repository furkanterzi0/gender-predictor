# Gender Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict gender based on image data. The system is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and includes processes for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes techniques for handling image data, resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **CNN Model:** Built and trained using deep learning frameworks to classify images.
- **Evaluation:** Provides accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance metrics.
- **User-Friendly Code:** Well-structured and modular code for easy understanding and customization.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language for data processing and modeling.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks used for building and training CNN models
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualization of training results and evaluation metrics.

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/furkanterzi0/gender-predictor.git
